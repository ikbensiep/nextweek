# nextweek
A simple calendar/todolist using localStorage

Nextweek is a plain todolist app, that allows users to enter todos for the current (or, on Sunday) the upcoming week.

Todos are a flat array, stored in and retrieved from localStorage.

Upon loading the app, the current weekday will be displayed and any todos for that day.

Every day has a maximum of 3 todos - just to keep things neat and tidy.
